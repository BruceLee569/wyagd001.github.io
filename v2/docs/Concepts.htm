<h2 id="values">值</h2>
<p><em>值</em> 只是程序中的一条信息. 例如, 要发送的键名或要运行的程序名, 热键被按下的次数, 要激活的窗口的标题, 或在程序或脚本中具有某种意义的其他任何内容.</p>
<p>AutoHotkey 支持这些类型的值:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#strings">字符串</a>(文本)</li>
  <li><a href="#numbers">数字</a>(整数和浮点数)</li>
  <li><a href="#objects">对象</a></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="commands/Type.htm">Type</a> 函数可用于确定值的类型.</p>
<p>其他一些相关的概念:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#boolean">布尔值</a></li>
  <li><a href="#nothing">空值</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="strings">字符串</h3>
<p><em>字符串</em> 只是文本. 每个字符串实际上是一个由字符组成的序列或 <em>字符串</em>, 但可以视为单个实体. 字符串的 <em>长度</em> 是序列中字符的数量, 而字符串中字符的 <em>位置</em> 只是该字符的序号. 按 AutoHotkey 中的约定, 第一个字符的位置为 1.</p>
<p>当数学运算或比较需要时, 数字字符串(或任何其他受支持的<a href="#numbers">数字格式</a>) 自动解释为数字.</p>
<p>脚本中如何书写原义文本, 取决于上下文. 例如, 在表达式中, <a href="Language.htm#strings">字符串</a>必须括在双引号中. 在指令(除了 #If) 和自动替换热字串中, 不需要双引号.</p>
<p>有关字符串如何工作的更详细说明, 请参阅<a href="#string-encoding">字符编码</a>.</p>

<h3 id="numbers">数字</h3>
<p>AutoHotkey 支持这些数字格式:</p>
<ul>
  <li>十进制整数, 如 <code>123</code>, <code>00123</code> 或 <code>-1</code>.</li>
  <li>十六进制整数, 如 <code>0x7B</code>, <code>0x007B</code> 或 <code>-0x1</code>.</li>
  <li>十进制浮点数, 如 <code>3.14159</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>除非本文档注明, 十六进制数字必须使用 <code>0x</code> 或 <code>0X</code> 前缀. 这个前缀必须写在 <code>+</code> 或 <code>-</code> 号之后(如果存在), 并且在前导零之前. 例如, <code>0x001</code> 有效, 但 <code>000x1</code> 无效.</p>
<p>带小数点的数字总是被认为是浮点数, 即使小数部分是零. 例如, <code>42</code> 和 <code>42.0</code> 通常可以互换, 但并非总是如此. 科学记数法也是认可的(例如 <code>1.0e4</code> 和 <code>-2.1E-4</code>), 但总是产生浮点数(即使没有小数点).</p>
<p>小数点分隔符总是一个点, 即使用户的区域设置指定了一个逗号.</p>
<p id="number-default-format">当数字被转换为字符串时, 它被格式化为十进制. 浮点数以全精度进行格式化(但是丢弃尾部多余的零), 这在某些情况下可能会暴露它们的<a href="#float-imprecision">不准确性</a>. 使用 <a href="commands/Format.htm">Format</a> 函数生成不同格式的数字字符串. 浮点数也可以使用  <a href="commands/Math.htm#Round">Round</a> 函数进行格式化.</p>
<p>有关数字值的范围和精度的详细信息, 请参阅<a href="#pure-numbers">纯数字</a>.</p>

<h3 id="boolean">布尔值</h3>
<p><em>布尔值</em> 可以是 <em>true</em> 或 <em>false</em>. 布尔值用于表示具有两种可能状态的任何东西, 例如表达式的 <em>真假</em>. 例如, 当 x 小于或等于 y 的值时, 表达式 <code>(x &lt;= y)</code> 为 <em>true</em>. 布尔值也可以表示 <em>yes</em> 或 <em>no</em>, <em>on</em> 或 <em>off</em>, <em>down</em> 或 <em>up</em>(如 <a href="commands/GetKeyState.htm">GetKeyState</a>) 等等.</p>
<p>AutoHotkey 没有特定的布尔类型, 因此它使用整数值 <code>0</code> 表示 false, 而 <code>1</code> 表示 true. 当要求判断一个值的真假时, 空白或零值被认为是假, 而所有其他值被认为是真. (对象总是被视为真.)</p>
<p>单词 <code>true</code> 和 <code>false</code> 是值分别为 1 和 0 的<a href="#built-in-variables">内置变量</a>. 使用它们可以增加脚本的可读性.</p>

<h3 id="nothing">空值</h3>
<p>AutoHotkey 中没有像其他语言那样有一个独特的表示 <em>nothing</em>, <em>null</em>, <em>nil</em> 或 <em>undefined</em> 的值. 相反, 一个空字符串(长度为零的字符串) 通常具有这个含义.</p>
<p>如果一个<a href="#variables">变量</a>或参数被称为 &quot;空&quot; 或 &quot;空白&quot;, 这通常意味着一个空字符串(长度为零的字符串).</p>

<h3 id="objects">对象</h3>
<p>通常有两种方式看待对象:</p>
<ul>
  <li>一个对象包含一组值, 允许这组值本身被视为一个值. 例如, an object could contain an <em>array</em> or sequence of items, or a set of related values, such as the X and Y coordinates of a position on the screen. Objects can be used to build complex structures by combining them with other objects.</li>
  <li>一个对象可以表示一个 <em>thing</em>, a <em>service</em>, or something else, and can provide ways for the script to interact with this thing or service. 例如, a <em>BankAccount</em> object might have properties such as the account number, current balance and the owner of the account, and methods to withdraw or deposit an amount.</li>
</ul>
<p>The proper use of objects (and in particular, <a href="Objects.htm#Custom_Classes">classes</a>) can result in code which is <em>modular</em> and <em>reusable</em>. Modular code is usually easier to test, understand and maintain. For instance, one can improve or modify one section of code without having to know the details of other sections, and without having to make corresponding changes to those sections. Reusable code saves time, by avoiding the need to write and test code for the same or similar tasks over and over.</p>
<p>When you assign an object to a <a href="#variables">variable</a>, as in <code>myObj := {}</code>, what you store is not the object itself, but a <a href="#references-to-objects"><em>reference</em></a> to the object. Copying that variable, as in <code>yourObj := myObj</code>, creates a new reference to the <em>same</em> object. A change such as <code>myObj.ans := 42</code> would be reflected by both <code>myObj.ans</code> and <code>yourObj.ans</code>, since they both refer to the same object. However, <code>myObj := Object()</code> only affects the variable <em>myObj</em>, not the variable <em>yourObj</em>, which still refers to the original object.</p>

<h3 id="object-protocol">对象协议</h3>
<p class="note">This section builds on these concepts which are covered in later sections: <a href="#variables">variables</a>, <a href="#functions">functions</a></p>
<p>Objects work through the principle of <em>message passing</em>. You don't know where an object's code or variables actually reside, so you must pass a message to the object, like &quot;give me <em>foo</em>&quot; or &quot;go do <em>bar</em>&quot;, and rely on the object to respond to the message. Objects in AutoHotkey support the following basic messages:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Get</strong> a value.</li>
  <li><strong>Set</strong> a value, denoted by <code>:=</code>.</li>
  <li><strong>Call</strong> a method, denoted by <code>()</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each message can optionally have one or more <a href="#parameters">parameters</a> (and, for <strong>Set</strong>, the value). Usually there is at least one parameter, and it is interpreted as the name of a property or method, a key or an array index, depending on the object and how you're using it. The parameters of a message are specified using three different patterns: <code>.Name</code>, <code>[Parameters]</code> and <code>(Parameters)</code>, where <em>Name</em> is a literal <a href="#names">name or identifier</a>, and <em>Parameters</em> is a list of parameters (as sub-expressions), which can be empty/blank (<code>[]</code> or <code>()</code>).</p>
<p>For <strong>Get</strong> and <strong>Set</strong>, <code>.Name</code> and <code>[Parameters]</code> can be used interchangeably, or in combination:</p>
<pre>myObj[arg1, arg2, ..., argN]
myObj.name
myObj.name[arg2, ..., argN]
</pre>
<p>For <strong>Call</strong>, <code>.Name</code> and <code>[Parameter]</code> can be used interchangeably, and must always be followed by <code>(Parameters)</code>:</p>
<pre>myObj.name(arg2, ..., argN)
myObj[arg1](arg2, ..., argN)
</pre>
<p>Notice that if <code>name</code> is present, it becomes the first parameter. <code>myObj.name</code> is equivalent to <code>myObj[&quot;name&quot;]</code>, while <code>myObj.123</code> is equivalent to <code>myObj[123]</code>. This is true for every type of object, so it is always possible to compute the name of a property or method at runtime, rather than hard-coding it into the script.</p>
<p>Although <em>name</em> or <em>arg1</em> is considered to be the first parameter, remember that these are just <em>messages</em>, and the object is free to handle them in any way. In a method call such as those shown above, usually the object uses <em>name</em> or <em>arg1</em> to identify which method should be called, and then only <em>arg2</em> and beyond are passed to the method. In effect, <em>arg2</em> becomes the method's first apparent parameter.</p>
<p>Generally, <strong>Set</strong> has the same meaning as an assignment, so it uses the same operator:</p>
<pre>myObj[arg1, arg2, ..., argN] := value
myObj.name := value
myObj.name[arg2, ..., argN] := value
</pre>
<p>Technically, <code>value</code> is passed as the last the parameter of the <em>Set</em> message; however, this detail is almost never relevant to script authors. Generally one can simply think of it as &quot;the value being assigned&quot;.</p>

<h2 id="variables">Variables</h2>
<p>A variable allows you to use a name as a placeholder for a value. Which value that is could change repeatedly during the time your script is running. 例如, a hotkey could use a variable <code>press_count</code> to count the number of times it is pressed, and send a different key whenever <code>press_count</code> is a multiple of 3 (every third press). Even a variable which is only assigned a value once can be useful. 例如, a <code>WebBrowserTitle</code> variable could be used to make your code easier to update when and if you were to change your preferred web browser, or if the <a href="misc/WinTitle.htm">title</a> or <a href="misc/WinTitle.htm#ahk_class">window class</a> changes due to a software update.</p>
<p>In AutoHotkey, variables are created simply by using them. Each variable is <em>not</em> permanently restricted to a single <a href="#values">data type</a>, but can instead hold a value of any type: string, number or object. Each variable starts off empty/blank; in other words, each newly created variable contains an empty string until it is assigned some other value.</p>
<p>A variable has three main aspects:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The variable's <em>name</em>.</li>
  <li>The variable itself.</li>
  <li>The variable's <em>value</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Certain restrictions apply to variable names - see <a href="#names">Names</a> for details. In short, it is safest to stick to names consisting of ASCII letters (which are case insensitive), digits and underscore, and to avoid using names that start with a digit.</p>
<p>A variable name has <strong><em>scope</em></strong>, which defines where in the code that name can be used to refer to that particular variable; in other words, where the variable is <em>visible</em>. If a variable is not visible within a given scope, the same name can refer to a different variable. Both variables might exist at the same time, but only one is visible to each part of the script. <a href="Functions.htm#Global">Global variables</a> are visible in the "global scope" (that is, outside of functions), but must usually be <a href="Functions.htm#Global">declared</a> to make them visible inside a function. <a href="Functions.htm#Local">Local variables</a> are visible only inside the function which created them.</p>
<p>A variable can be thought of as a container or storage location for a value, so you'll often find the documentation refers to a variable's value as <em>the contents of the variable</em>. For a variable <code>x := 42</code>, we can also say that the variable x has the number 42 as its value, or that the value of x is 42.</p>
<p>It is important to note that a variable and its value are not the same thing. For instance, we might say &quot;<code>myArray</code> is an array&quot;, but what we really mean is that myArray is a variable containing a reference to an array. We're taking a shortcut by using the name of the variable to refer to its value, but &quot;myArray&quot; is really just the name of the variable; the array object doesn't know that it has a name, and could be referred to by many different variables (and therefore many names).</p>

<h3 id="uninitialised-variables">Uninitialised Variables</h3>
<p>To <em>initialise</em> a variable is to assign it a starting value. Although the program automatically initialises all variables (an empty string being the default value), it is good practice for a script to always initialise its variables before use. That way, anyone reading the script can see what variables the script will be using and what starting values they are expected to have.</p>
<p>It is usually necessary for the script to initialise any variable which is expected to hold a number. 例如, <code>x := x + 1</code> will not work if x has never been assigned a value, since the <em>empty string</em> is considered to be non-numeric. The script should have assigned a starting value, such as <code>x := 0</code>. There are some cases where empty values <em>are</em> assumed to be 0, but it is best not to rely on this.</p>
<p>Script authors can use the <a href="commands/_Warn.htm">#Warn</a> directive to help find instances where a variable is used without having been initialised by the script.</p>

<h3 id="built-in-variables">Built-in Variables</h3>
<p>A number of useful variables are built into the program and can be referenced by any script. Except where noted, these variables are read-only; that is, their contents cannot be directly altered by the script. By convention, most of these variables start with the prefix <code>A_</code>, so it is best to avoid using this prefix for your own variables.</p>
<p>Some variables such as <a href="Variables.htm#KeyDelay">A_KeyDelay</a> and <a href="Variables.htm#TitleMatchMode">A_TitleMatchMode</a> represent settings that control the script's behavior, and retain separate values for each <a href="misc/Threads.htm">thread</a>. This allows subroutines launched by new threads (such as for hotkeys, menus, timers and such) to change settings without affecting other threads.</p>
<p>Some special variables are not updated periodically, but rather their value is retrieved or calculated whenever the script references the variable. 例如, <a href="misc/Clipboard.htm">Clipboard</a> retrieves the current contents of the clipboard as text, and <a href="Variables.htm#TimeSinceThisHotkey">A_TimeSinceThisHotkey</a> calculates the number of milliseconds that have elapsed since the hotkey was pressed.</p>
<p>Related: <a href="Variables.htm#BuiltIn">list of built-in variables</a>.</p>

<h3 id="environment-variables">Environment Variables</h3>
<p>Environment variables are maintained by the operating system. You can see a list of them at the command prompt by typing SET then pressing Enter.</p>
<p>A script may create a new environment variable or change the contents of an existing one with <a href="commands/EnvSet.htm">EnvSet</a>. Such additions and changes are not seen by the rest of the system. However, any programs or scripts which the script launches by calling <a href="commands/Run.htm">Run</a> or <a href="commands/Run.htm">RunWait</a> usually inherit a copy of the parent script's environment variables.</p>
<p>To retrieve an environment variable, use <a href="commands/EnvGet.htm">EnvGet</a>. 例如:</p>
<pre>Path := EnvGet("PATH")</pre>

<h3 id="caching">Caching</h3>
<p>Although a variable is typically thought of as holding a single value, and that value having a distinct type (string, number or object), AutoHotkey automatically converts between numbers and strings in cases like <code>"Value is " myNumber</code> and <code>MsgBox myNumber</code>. As these conversions can happen very frequently, whenever a variable containing a number is converted to a string, the result is <em>cached</em> in the variable.</p>
<p>Currently, AutoHotkey v2 caches a pure number only when assigning a pure number to a variable, not when reading it. This preserves the ability to differentiate between strings and pure numbers (such as with the <a href="commands/Type.htm">Type</a> function, or when passing values to COM objects).</p>

<h2 id="functions">Functions</h2>
<p>A <em>function</em> is the basic means by which a script <em>does something</em>.</p>
<p>Functions can have many different purposes. Some functions might do no more than perform a simple calculation, while others have immediately visible effects, such as moving a window. One of AutoHotkey's strengths is the ease with which scripts can automate other programs and perform many other common tasks by simply calling a few functions. See the <a href="commands/index.htm">function list</a> for examples.</p>
<p>Throughout this documentation, some common words are used in ways that might not be obvious to someone without prior experience. Below are several such words/phrases which are used frequently in relation to 函数:</p>
<dl>
  <dt id="call">Call a function</dt>
  <dd><p><em>Calling</em> a function causes the program to invoke, execute or evaluate it. In other words, a <em>function call</em> temporarily transfers control from the script to the function. When the function has completed its purpose, it <em>returns</em> control to the script. In other words, any code following the function call does not execute until after the function completes.</p>
  <p>However, sometimes a function completes before its effects can be seen by the user. 例如, the <a href="commands/Send.htm">Send</a> function <em>sends</em> keystrokes, but may return before the keystrokes reach their destination and cause their intended effect.</p></dd>
  <dt id="parameters">Parameters</dt>
  <dd><p>Usually a function accepts <em>parameters</em> which tell it how to operate or what to operate on. Each parameter is a <a href="#values">value</a>, such as a string or number. 例如, <a href="commands/WinMove.htm">WinMove</a> moves a window, so its parameters tell it which window to move and where to move it to. Parameters can also be called <em>arguments</em>. Common abbreviations include <em>param</em> and <em>arg</em>.</p></dd>
  <dt id="pass-parameters">Pass parameters</dt>
  <dd><p>Parameters are <em>passed</em> to a function, meaning that a value is specified for each parameter of the function when it is called. 例如, one can <em>pass</em> the name of a key to <a href="commands/GetKeyState.htm">GetKeyState</a> to determine whether that key is being held down.</p></dd>
  <dt id="return-a-value">Return a value</dt>
  <dd><p>Functions <em>return</em> a value, so the result of the function is often called a <em>return value</em>. 例如, <a href="commands/StrLen.htm">StrLen</a> returns the number of characters in a string. Commands do not return a result directly; instead, they store the result in a <a href="#variables">variable</a>. Functions may also do this, such as when there is more than one result.</p></dd>
  <dt id="command">Command</dt>
  <dd><p>A function call is sometimes called a <em>command</em>, such as if it <em>commands</em> the program to take a specific action. For historical reasons, <em>command</em> may refer to a particular style of calling a function, where the parentheses are omitted and the return value is discarded.</p></dd>
</dl>
<p>Functions usually expect parameters to be written in a specific order, so the meaning of each parameter value depends on its position in the comma-delimited list of parameters. Some parameters can be omitted, in which case the parameter can be left blank, but the comma following it can only be omitted if all remaining parameters are also omitted. 例如, the syntax for <a href="commands/ControlSend.htm">ControlSend</a> is:</p>
<pre class="Syntax"><span class="func">ControlSend</span> Keys <span class="optional">, Control, WinTitle, WinText, ExcludeTitle, ExcludeText</span>
</pre>
<p>Square brackets signify that the enclosed parameters are optional (the brackets themselves should not appear in the actual code). However, usually one must also specify the target window. 例如:</p>
<pre>
ControlSend "^{Home}", "Edit1", "A"  <em>; Correct. Control is specified.</em>
ControlSend "^{Home}", "A"           <em>; Incorrect: Parameters are mismatched.</em>
ControlSend "^{Home}",, "A"          <em>; Correct. Control is omitted.</em>
</pre>

<h3 id="methods">Methods</h3>
<p><em>Methods</em> are functions which operate on a particular <a href="#objects">object</a>. While there can only be one function named <code>Send</code> (for example), there can be as many methods named <code>Send</code> as there are objects, as each object (or class of objects) can respond in a different way. For this reason, the target object (which may be a variable or sub-expression) is specified to left of the method name instead of inside the parameter list. For details, 请参阅 <a href="#object-protocol">Object Protocol</a>.</p>

<h2 id="control-flow">Control Flow</h2>
<p><em>Control flow</em> is the order in which individual statements are executed. Normally statements are executed sequentially from top to bottom, but a control flow statement can override this, such as by specifying that statements should be executed repeatedly, or only if a certain condition is met.</p>
<dl>
  <dt id="statement">Statement</dt>
  <dd><p>A <em>statement</em> is simply the smallest standalone element of the language that expresses some action to be carried out. In AutoHotkey, statements include assignments, function calls and other expressions. However, directives, labels (including hotkeys and hotstrings), and declarations without assignments are not statements; they are processed when the program first starts up, before the script <em>executes</em>.</p></dd>
  <dt id="execute">Execute</dt>
  <dd><p>Carry out, perform, evaluate, put into effect, etc. <em>Execute</em> basically has the same meaning as in non-programming speak.</p></dd>
  <dt id="cf-body">Body</dt>
  <dd><p>The <em>body</em> of a control flow statement is the statement or group of statements to which it applies. 例如, the body of an <a href="commands/IfExpression.htm">if statement</a> is executed only if a specific condition is met.</p></dd>
</dl>
<p>例如, consider this simple set of instructions:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open Notepad</li>
  <li>Wait for Notepad to appear on the screen</li>
  <li>Type &quot;Hello, world!&quot;</li>
</ol>
<p>We take one step at a time, and when that step is finished, we move on to the next step. In the same way, control in a program or script usually flows from one statement to the next statement. But what if we want to type into an existing Notepad window? Consider this revised set of instructions:</p>
<ol>
  <li>If Notepad is not running:
<ol>
  <li>Open Notepad</li>
  <li>Wait for Notepad to appear on the screen</li>
</ol>
</li>
  <li>Otherwise:
<ol>
  <li>Activate Notepad</li>
</ol>
</li>
  <li>Type &quot;Hello, world!&quot;</li>
</ol>
<p>So we either open Notepad or activate Notepad depending on whether it is already running. #1 is a <em>conditional statement</em>, also known as an <em>if statement</em>; that is, we execute its <em>body</em> (#1.1 - #1.2) only if a condition is met. #2 is an <em>else statement</em>; we execute its body (#2.1) only if the condition of a previous <em>if statement</em> (#1) is not met. Depending on the condition, control <em>flows</em> one of two ways: #1 (if true) &rarr; #1.1 &rarr; #1.2 &rarr; #3; or #1 (if false) &rarr; #2 (else) &rarr; #2.1 &rarr; #3.</p>
<p>The instructions above can be translated into the code below:</p>
<pre>if (not WinExist(&quot;ahk_class Notepad&quot;))
{
    Run "Notepad"
    WinWait "ahk_class Notepad"
}
else
    WinActivate "ahk_class Notepad"
Send "Hello, world!"
</pre>
<p>In our written instructions, we used indentation and numbering to group the statements. Scripts work a little differently. Although indentation makes code easier to read, in AutoHotkey it does not affect the grouping of statements. Instead, statements are grouped by enclosing them in braces, as shown above. This is called a <a href="commands/Block.htm"><em>block</em></a>.</p>
<p class="note">For details about syntax - that is, how to write or recognise control flow statements in AutoHotkey - see <a href="Language.htm#control-flow">Control Flow</a>.</p>

<h2 id="details">Details</h2>

<h3 id="string-encoding">String Encoding</h3>
<p>Each character in the string is represented by a number, called its <em>ordinal number</em>, or <em>character code</em>. 例如, the value &quot;Abc&quot; would be represented as follows:</p>
<table class="info" style="width: 8em; text-align: center">
  <tr><td>A</td><td>b</td><td>c</td></tr>
  <tr><td>65</td><td>98</td><td>99</td></tr>
</table>
<p>The <em>encoding</em> of a string is the way in which numbers are mapped to symbols. There are many different encodings, but as all of those supported by AutoHotkey include ASCII as a subset, character codes 0 to 127 always have the same meaning. 例如, 'A' always has the character code 65.</p>
<p>Although AutoHotkey provides ways to work with text in various encodings, the built-in functions--and to some degree the language itself--all assume string values to be in one particular encoding. This is referred to as the <em>native</em> encoding. The native encoding depends on the version of AutoHotkey:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
<p>Unicode versions of AutoHotkey use UTF-16. The smallest element in a UTF-16 string is two bytes (16 bits). Unicode characters in the range 0 to 65535 (U+FFFF) are represented by a single 16-bit code unit of the same value, while characters in the range 65536 (U+10000) to 1114111 (U+10FFFF) are represented by a <em>surrogate pair</em>; that is, exactly two 16-bit code units between 0xD800 and 0xDFFF. (For further explanation of surrogate pairs and methods of encoding or decoding them, search the Internet.)</p>

<p>ANSI versions of AutoHotkey use the system default ANSI code page, which depends on the system locale or &quot;language for non-Unicode programs&quot; system setting. The smallest element of an ANSI string is one byte. However, some code pages contain characters which are represented by sequences of multiple bytes (these are always non-ASCII characters).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> There is currently no ANSI version of AutoHotkey v2.</p>
<p>Generally, other parts of this documentation use the term &quot;character&quot; to mean a string's smallest unit; bytes for ANSI strings and 16-bit code units for Unicode strings. For practical reasons, the length of a string and positions within a string are measured by counting these fixed-size units, even though they may not be complete Unicode characters.</p>
<p><a href="commands/FileRead.htm">FileRead</a>, <a href="commands/FileAppend.htm">FileAppend</a>, <a href="commands/FileOpen.htm">FileOpen</a> and the <a href="objects/File.htm">File object</a> provide ways of reading and writing text in files with a specific encoding.</p>
<p>The functions <a href="commands/StrGet.htm">StrGet</a> and <a href="commands/StrPut.htm">StrPut</a> can be used to convert strings between the native encoding and some other specified encoding. However, these are usually only useful in combination with data structures and the <a href="commands/DllCall.htm">DllCall</a> function. Strings which are passed directly to or from <a href="commands/DllCall.htm">DllCall</a> can be converted to ANSI or UTF-16 by using the <code>AStr</code> or <code>WStr</code> parameter types.</p>

<h3 id="pure-numbers">Pure Numbers</h3>
<p>A <em>pure</em> or <em>binary</em> number is one which is stored in memory in a format that the computer's CPU can directly work with, such as to perform math. In most cases, AutoHotkey automatically converts between numeric strings and pure numbers as needed, and rarely differentiates between the two types. AutoHotkey primarily uses two data types for pure numbers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>64-bit signed integers (<em>int64</em>).</li>
  <li>64-bit binary floating-point numbers (the <em>double</em> or <em>binary64</em> format of the IEEE 754 international standard).</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, scripts are affected by the following limitations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
<p>Integers must be within the signed 64-bit range; that is, -9223372036854775808 (-0x8000000000000000, or -2<sup>63</sup>) to 9223372036854775807 (0x7FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF, or 2<sup>63</sup>-1). If an integer constant in an expression is outside this range, only the low 64 bits are used (the value is truncated). Although larger values can be contained within a string, any attempt to convert the string to a number (such as by using it in a math operation) will cause it to be similarly truncated.</p>
</li>
  <li>
<p>Floating-point numbers generally support 15 digits of precision.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="float-imprecision"><strong>Note:</strong> There are some decimal fractions which the binary floating-point format cannot precisely represent, so a number is rounded to the closest representable number. This may lead to unexpected results. 例如:</p>
<pre>
MsgBox 0.1 + 0           <em>; 0.10000000000000001</em>
MsgBox 0.1 + 0.2         <em>; 0.30000000000000004</em>
MsgBox 0.3 + 0           <em>; 0.29999999999999999</em>
MsgBox 0.1 + 0.2 = 0.3   <em>; 0 (not equal)</em>
</pre>
<p>One strategy for dealing with this is to avoid direct comparison, instead comparing the difference. 例如:</p>
<pre>MsgBox Abs((0.1 + 0.2) - (0.3)) &lt; 0.0000000000000001
</pre>
<p>Another strategy is to explicitly apply rounding before comparison, such as by converting to a string. There are generally two ways to do this while specifying the precision, and both are shown below:</p>
<pre>MsgBox Round(0.1 + 0.2, 15) = Format(&quot;{:.15f}&quot;, 0.3)
</pre>

<h3 id="names">名称</h3>
<p>AutoHotkey 使用一组相同的规则来命名各种东西, 包括变量, 函数, <a href="commands/GroupAdd.htm">窗口组</a>, 类, 属性和方法. 规则如下.</p>
<p><strong>大小写敏感性:</strong> ASCII 字符不区分大小写. 例如, <code>CurrentDate</code> 等同于 <code>currentdate</code>. 但是, 大写的非 ASCII 字符(如 'Ä') <em>不</em> 被认为等同于他们的小写字母, 不管当前用户的区域设置如何. 这有助于脚本在多个语言环境中保持一致.</p>
<p><strong>最大长度:</strong> 253 characters.</p>
<p><strong>允许的字符:</strong> 字母, 数字, 下划线(_) 和非 ASCII 字符; 然而, 第一个字符不能是数字.</p>
<p id="reserved-words"><strong>保留单词:</strong> <code>and</code>, <code>contains</code>, <code>in</code>, <code>is</code>, <code>new</code>, <code>not</code> 和 <code>or</code>. 这些单词保留作<a href="Language.htm#operators">运算符</a>使用, and therefore cannot be used as variable names when written literally in an expression.</p>
<p>Names of control flow statements are also reserved, primarily to detect mistakes. This includes: <code>Break</code>, <code>Catch</code>, <code>Continue</code>, <code>Else</code>, <code>Finally</code>, <code>For</code>, <code>Gosub</code>, <code>Goto</code>, <code>If</code>, <code>Loop</code>, <code>Return</code>, <code>Throw</code>, <code>Try</code>, <code>Until</code>, <code>While</code></p>

<h3 id="variable-references">Variable References vs Values</h3>
<p>Variables have certain attributes that blur the line between a variable and its value, but it is important to make the distinction. In particular, consider <a href="#objects">objects</a> and ByRef parameters.</p>
<p>Although we may say the variable <code>myArray</code> <em>contains</em> an array (which is a type of object), what the variable contains isn't the array itself but rather a <em>reference or pointer</em> to the array. Any number of variables can contain a reference to the same object. It may be helpful to think of a variable as just a name in that case. For instance, giving a person a nickname doesn't cause a clone of that person to come into existence.</p>
<p>By default, variables are passed to user-defined functions <em>by value</em>. In other words, the value contained by the variable is copied into the variable which corresponds to the function's parameter. <strong>ByRef</strong> parameters allow you to pass a variable <em>by reference</em>, or in other words, to make one parameter of the function an <em>alias</em> for your variable, allowing the function to assign a new value to your variable.</p>
<p>Because a variable only ever contains a <em>reference</em> to an object and not the object itself, when you pass such a variable to a non-ByRef parameter, what the function receives is a reference to the same object. This allows the function to modify the object, but it does not allow the function to modify the <em>variable</em> which the function's caller used, because the function only has a reference to the object, not the variable.</p>

<h3 id="references-to-objects">References to Objects</h3>
<p>Scripts interact with an object only indirectly, through a <em>reference</em> to the object. When you create an object, the object is created at some location you don't control, and you're given a reference. Passing this reference to a function or storing it in a variable or another object creates a new reference to the <em>same</em> object. You release a reference by simply using an assignment to replace it with any other value. An object is deleted only after all references have been released; you cannot delete an object explicitly, and should not try.</p>
<pre>ref1 := Object()  <em>; Create an object and store first reference</em>
ref2 := ref1      <em>; Create a new reference to the same object</em>
ref1 := &quot;&quot;        <em>; Release the first reference</em>
ref2 := &quot;&quot;        <em>; Release the second reference; object is deleted</em>
</pre>
<p>If that's difficult to understand, try thinking of an object as a rental unit. When you rent a unit, you're given a key which you can use to access the unit. You can get more keys and use them to access the same unit, but when you're finished with the unit, you must hand all keys back to the rental agent. Usually a unit wouldn't be <em>deleted</em>, but maybe the agent will have any junk you left behind removed; just as any values you stored in an object are freed when the object is deleted.</p>
